            <p>
                This web page is made for the subject IT2805 the fall of 2018 as part P1 of the group project.
                We have chosen to make a web page for the resturant called Lyche, located at Studertersamfundet in Trondheim.

            <h2>Content and organization</h2>
            <!--Think of this as the outline of a paper: it  doesn't  have  to  spell  out  the  sentences  or  even  the  paragraphs, 
                    but  it should  mention major sections and even a few salient subsections-->
            
            <p>
                We wish to have a simple and well-organized page for Lyche, with just the info the audience are looking for. 
                Pages and the linking between pages are shown in the diagram below.
